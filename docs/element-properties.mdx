### 1. tagName

`Element.tagName : string`

`.tagName` is a read-only property on any element, which returns the tag name in uppercase form. This is useful to identify type of a element.

Ex. For a `<div/>` element, tagName is `"DIV"`. 

```js
ele = document.querySelector("img");
ele.tagName // "IMG"
```

:::note Text nodes don't have `tagName`

Text nodes are not element, so they don't have any tagName - it'll just give `undefined`.

## Children and Content

:::note Types of Children

All elements will *generally* have 2 types of children - 1. element and 2. text node.
You can think of elements as other tags and text node as the text within a tag. 

```jsx
<div>
  This is  // <- 1. text node
  <span>   // <- 2. element
    some text // 2.1. <span> contains text node
  </span>
</div>
```

If you recall, *Element* extends from *Node* - so all elements are nodes. That means, every child is technically a node.  
This is important because some properties return **only child elements**, whereas others return **all child nodes** (both element and text node). For ex, `ele.childNodes` returns all child nodes, but `ele.children` returns only child elements. 

**Always use the one which is more suitable for your case**. Remember, even if you haven't added any "text" between a tag, it can still have **invisible text nodes** due to spaces and newline characters.

```jsx
<div id="container">
  <div></div>
</div>

container.childNodes // [text, div, text]
// extra text nodes contain newline and space characters
```
