# [Ui Questions](http://uiquestions.com/)

> Need a quick review before UI/Frontend interview? Start at http://uiquestions.com/

Primary goal of the website is to have "I have 30 minutes before interview"-style coverage of frontend topics.  
It should be short, with links to other websites for further reading.

The first section will be on **DOM and events**, then I'll add some common UI tasks asked in interview, like how to build *infinite scroll*.
